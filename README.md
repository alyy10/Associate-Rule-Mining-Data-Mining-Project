## Methodology

The market basket analysis is performed through a structured methodology involving data preprocessing, Apriori algorithm implementation, and association rule mining.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* **Data Cleaning:** Removal of duplicates, handling missing values, and standardization of item names.
* **Transaction Encoding:** Conversion of transactional data to a binary matrix format.
* **Basket Transformation:** Grouping items by transaction ID to create shopping baskets.
* **Frequency Analysis:** Calculation of item frequency and filtering of rare items.

### 2. Apriori Algorithm Implementation

The Apriori algorithm is used to discover frequent itemsets. The key steps and parameters are:

* **Algorithm Steps:**

  1. Set minimum support threshold.
  2. Find frequent 1-itemsets.
  3. Generate candidate itemsets.
  4. Prune infrequent itemsets.
  5. Repeat until no more frequent itemsets.
* **Key Parameters:**

  * **Min Support:** 0.01 (1%)
  * **Min Confidence:** 0.2 (20%)
  * **Min Lift:** 1.0
  * **Max Length:** 5 items

### 3. Association Rule Mining

Association rules are generated from frequent itemsets using three key metrics:

* **Support:** Frequency of an itemset in the dataset.
  * `Support(A) = Count(A) / Total Transactions`
* **Confidence:** Conditional probability of the consequent given the antecedent.
  * `Conf(A→B) = Support(A∪B) / Support(A)`
* **Lift:** Strength of the rule correlation, indicating how much more likely the consequent is given the antecedent, relative to its baseline probability.
  * `Lift(A→B) = Conf(A→B) / Support(B)`

## Detailed Code Analysis

### Main Analysis Notebook

This Jupyter notebook is the core of the project, containing the complete Market Basket Analysis implementation. It is structured into multiple sections for comprehensive analysis.

#### Key Sections:

1. **Data Import and Exploration:**

   * Loads transaction data from `data/transactions.csv`.
   * Prints dataset shape, unique transactions, and unique items.
   * Displays a sample of the transaction data.

   ```python
   # Data loading and initial exploration
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
   from mlxtend.preprocessing import TransactionEncoder

   # Load transaction data
   df = pd.read_csv('data/transactions.csv')
   print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
   print(f"Unique transactions: {df['Transaction'].nunique()}")
   print(f"Unique items: {df['Item'].nunique()}")

   # Display sample transactions
   df.head(10)
   ```
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**

   * Removes 'NONE' items and duplicates from the dataset.
   * Transforms the data into a binary encoded DataFrame suitable for the Apriori algorithm.
   * Filters out infrequent items based on a minimum support threshold.

   ```python
   # Remove 'NONE' items
   df_cleaned = df[df['Item'] != 'NONE']
   print(f"Shape after removing 'NONE' items: {df_cleaned.shape}")

   # Remove duplicates
   df_cleaned.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
   print(f"Shape after removing duplicates: {df_cleaned.shape}")

   # Create transaction baskets
   baskets = df_cleaned.groupby('Transaction')['Item'].apply(list).values.tolist()

   # Transform to binary encoding
   te = TransactionEncoder()
   te_ary = te.fit(baskets).transform(baskets)
   df_encoded = pd.DataFrame(te_ary, columns=te.columns_)

   # Remove items with low frequency
   item_frequencies = df_encoded.mean()
   frequent_items = item_frequencies[item_frequencies >= 0.01].index
   df_filtered = df_encoded[frequent_items]
   print(f"Items after filtering: {len(frequent_items)}")
   print(f"Dataset shape after preprocessing: {df_filtered.shape}")
   ```
3. **Frequent Itemset Generation:**

   * Applies the Apriori algorithm to the preprocessed data to find frequent itemsets.
   * Sorts the frequent itemsets by support in descending order.

   ```python
   # Apply Apriori algorithm
   frequent_itemsets = apriori(df_filtered,
                               min_support=0.01,
                               use_colnames=True,
                               verbose=1)

   # Sort by support
   frequent_itemsets = frequent_itemsets.sort_values('support', ascending=False)
   print(f"Number of frequent itemsets: {len(frequent_itemsets)}")
   print("\nTop 10 frequent itemsets:")
   print(frequent_itemsets.head(10))
   ```
4. **Association Rule Mining:**

   * Generates association rules from the frequent itemsets using confidence as the primary metric.
   * Calculates additional metrics like `leverage` and `conviction`.
   * Sorts the rules by `lift` in descending order to highlight the strongest correlations.

   ```python
   # Generate association rules
   rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets,
                             metric="confidence",
                             min_threshold=0.2,
                             num_itemsets=len(frequent_itemsets))

   # Add leverage and conviction metrics
   rules['leverage'] = rules['support'] - (rules['antecedent support'] * rules['consequent support'])
   rules['conviction'] = (1 - rules['consequent support']) / (1 - rules['confidence'])

   # Sort by lift
   rules_sorted = rules.sort_values('lift', ascending=False)
   print(f"Number of association rules: {len(rules)}")
   print("\nTop 10 rules by lift:")
   print(rules_sorted[['antecedents', 'consequents', 'support', 'confidence', 'lift']].head(10))
   ```
5. **Advanced Visualizations:**

   * Utilizes `plotly` and `networkx` for interactive visualizations.
   * Generates a scatter plot of Support vs. Confidence, sized and colored by Lift.
   * Creates a network graph of the top association rules, where nodes represent items/itemsets and edges represent rules, weighted by lift.
   * Exports the network graph to a GEXF file for further analysis in tools like Gephi.

   ```python
   # Create interactive visualizations
   import plotly.graph_objects as go
   import plotly.express as px
   from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

   # Support vs Confidence scatter plot
   fig = px.scatter(rules, x='support', y='confidence',
                    size='lift', color='lift',
                    hover_data=['antecedents', 'consequents'],
                    title='Association Rules: Support vs Confidence')
   fig.show()

   # Network graph for top rules
   import networkx as nx

   G = nx.DiGraph()
   for _, rule in rules_sorted.head(20).iterrows():
       antecedent = ', '.join(list(rule['antecedents']))
       consequent = ', '.join(list(rule['consequents']))
       G.add_edge(antecedent, consequent, weight=rule['lift'])

   # Export network to HTML
   nx.write_gexf(G, 'basket_network.gexf')
   ```

## Network Visualization Files

* `Network_numer_1.html`: Interactive network visualization of association rules. Node size represents item frequency, edge thickness shows rule confidence, and color coding is by lift values. Includes interactive hover information, zoom, and pan functionality.
* `Network_number_2.html`: Alternative network layout with clustering. Features community detection algorithms and product category clustering. Uses a force-directed layout with dynamic filtering options.

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start Guide

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure your transaction data is in the correct format (columns: `TransactionID`, `ItemName`).
2. **Environment Setup:** Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run Analysis:** Open `Lab3.ipynb` in Jupyter and execute all cells sequentially.
4. **View Results:** Check the generated CSV files (`association_rules.csv`, `frequent_itemsets.csv`) and HTML visualizations (`Basket_Network1.html`, `Basket_Network2.html`).
5. **Customize Parameters:** Adjust `min_support` and `min_confidence` thresholds based on your dataset and business objectives.

### Advanced Configuration

The analysis can be configured with custom parameters:

```python
config = {
    'min_support': 0.01,         # Minimum support threshold (1%)
    'min_confidence': 0.2,       # Minimum confidence threshold (20%)
    'min_lift': 1.0,             # Minimum lift value
    'max_itemset_length': 5,     # Maximum items in itemset
    'remove_rare_items': True,   # Filter items below support threshold
    'export_format': ['csv', 'json', 'html'] # Output formats
}

# Example of running analysis with custom config (assuming a function `run_market_basket_analysis` exists)
# results = run_market_basket_analysis(data, config)
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Memory Issues:** Reduce `min_support` or filter the dataset if processing large files.
* **No Rules Generated:** Lower the `min_confidence` threshold or verify the quality of your input data.
